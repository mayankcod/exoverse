# Exoverse

## Overview
This project is an interactive tool designed for exploring exoplanets using Three.js. It simulates the behavior of exoplanets in a 3D space environment, showcasing realistic interactions based on NASA data. The tool aims to provide an immersive experience for users to explore the fascinating world of exoplanets.

## Features
- **3D Visualization**: The exoplanets are rendered in a 3D space, allowing users to view them from different angles.
- **Realistic Behaviors**: The planets' movements and interactions are based on scientific data, ensuring a realistic representation.
- **Exoplanet Data**: The tool uses real NASA data to simulate real-world exoplanets, including their sizes, distances from stars, and orbital characteristics.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can interact with the simulation by zooming in and out, rotating the view, and clicking on planets to get detailed information.

## Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for 3D graphics rendering in the browser.
- **NASA Exoplanet Data**: Data sourced from NASA's Exoplanet Exploration database to drive the simulation's realism.
- **WebGL**: A technology for rendering interactive 3D graphics in the web browser.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the web interface.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and handling the simulation logic
